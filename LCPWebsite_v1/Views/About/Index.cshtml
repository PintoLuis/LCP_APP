                <p>My name is Luís Carlos Freitas Pinto. I was born on April 26, 1985 in the city of Chaves and from an early age I try to fulfill my dreams.</p>
                <p>I learned that nothing in life comes easily and good education and respect make us better people. I discovered the importance of fighting for what you want and dream, I do it every day. Today I consider myself a determined, focused and persistent person. I believe that the future will be even better and that gives me more willpower to pursue it.</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote text-center"> Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.</blockquote>
                <p>I value my family very much and, even more, the moments that I spend with them. It is an important pillar in my education, in my formation and in my daily life. In spite of the defects that I have as well as all people, I try to minimize such defects with the qualities that I possess. As a young man I had the dream of being a professional basketball player and played for 13 years. I met some amazing people and I have had incredible moments all these years.</p>
                <p>All my education up to high school was done in Vila Real, city where I went to live with 7 years. I studied in a public school and gradually I learned both the subjects and to build and maintain friendly relations. I became quite communicative.</p>
                <p>During my adolescence I always dreamed of being a civil engineer but the taste for informatics was superior and I went to study in Management Informatics at Institute Polytechnic of Bragança. This period of my life has been very important, developing my knowledge and learn more new competencies, both technical and personal. I've done Erasmus program, I went to study in Poland, more precisely Poznan. All students should attend this type of programs because it gives other perspectives of life and great teachings.</p>
                <p>At this moment of my life I live and work in Lisbon, where I am a .NET programmer and consultant. I try to be a better professional every day, and always try to improve my skills and competencies. </p>
                <p>I'm not a perfect person, but I'm always trying to improve. After all, we know that maturation comes with time and experiences, and I always seek to learn from mine.</p>
